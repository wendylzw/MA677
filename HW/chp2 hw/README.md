**Due – Wednesday, February 10**

In Chapter 3 of G&S book, Example 3.11 uses the binomial distribution to demonstrate the logic of
hypothesis testing with a simple example.

The intuitive simplicity of the example and the availability of tools in R for calculations and plotting
distributions encourages you to explore hypothesis testing by reproducing the results presented in
the book.

In the final paragraph of the example on page 102, the authors write, ”A few experiments have
shown us that ... ”. They report the results but don’t show you their experiments. Similarly, they
show you Figure 3.7, but not how it was produced.

Your assignment is to fill in these gaps. Produce an explanation of the example showing how the
authors reached their conclusion that the critical value should be between 69 and 73 people cured.
Replicate and explain Figure 3.7.
